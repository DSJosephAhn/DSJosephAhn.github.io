The 3 purposes of this blog for me are descripted below.

[Professional](#linking-in-style) [design](#whats-in-the-cards), [big headlines](#ready-for-the-big-screen), big new features: [Built-In Search](#built-in-search), [Sticky Table of Contents](#sticky-table-of-contents), and [Auto-Hiding Navbar](#auto-hiding-navbar). That [and more](#and-much-more) is Hydejack 9.

## Sharing my experiences and knowledges about Data Science and AI
From what I've lived till now, I continuously have been making heavy effort to know who I am.
I like to understand the cause of an event, and approaches to explain how it happens with data.
[Data science](#linking-in-style) is a way of proving it.
 
## Strength and characteristics
I'm a passionate and proactive learner.
Since my son was born, I swore myself to be a good daddy for him.
I'd like to define data science for me as an word, sincerity.[^1]. 
 
## Exciting and adventurous challenges
I've tried to find out how to actualize my idea and make a thing from nothing.
Data have explanable insights, and I really enjoy extracting them from data. 
[image link](../../docs/basics.md#adding-images) has been added to the documentation.

 
## …and much more

Other noteworthy changes include:
- Support for Jekyll 4
- Choice between MathJax and KaTeX for math rendering
- Use of `jekyll-include-cache` for drastically improved page building speeds
- New variables configuration file — adjust content width, sidebar width, font size, etc...
- ...and the option to disable grouping projects by year.

Read the the [CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md){:.heading.flip-title} for the full scope of features and improvements made in Hydejack 9.
Maybe just glance at it to confirm that it is indeed a pretty long list.
 
## Even More to Come

New features for 9.1 are already lined up. Code block headers and code line highlights for even better technical blogging, as well as download buttons on the resume page for PDF, vCard, and Resume JSON are just around the corner.
 
## Get It Now
The Free Version of Hydejack is now availabe on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-hydejack)
and for the first time also on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/packages). 
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack) as always.

The PRO Version is scheduled to release on July 7th on Gumroad. Pre-Orders are open now:

[^1]: If you are a fan of the old two-column layout, or don't like modern design tropes such as mega headlines, Hydejack lets you revert these changes on a case-by-case basis via configuration options.

      Search was mainly tested for English and German. Please let me know about issues in other languages. 
      While I've tried to find a multi-language solution, most showed drastically worse  results for the English base case.
      If you're technically inclined, you can adopt the code located in `_includes/js/search-worker.js` to your needs.
